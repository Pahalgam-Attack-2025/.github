# Introduction

After the Pahalgam Attack in the Baisaran valley, Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 26 people, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Cabinet Committee on Security endorsed a five-point response plan against Pakistan. According to reports, the Pahalgam Terror Attack was carried out by the Resistance Front (TRF), a front for the outlawed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) organization located in Pakistan.

## What is the 5-Point Action Plan Announced by India After the Pahalgam Attack?

1. **Suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty**  
   The 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) has been suspended by India until Pakistan stops sponsoring cross-border terrorism. It shows a change in India’s strategic thinking by employing hydrological leverage as a means of exerting pressure.

2. **Closure of the Attari-Wagah Border Check Post**  
   India has suspended all human and commercial traffic at the Integrated Check Post (ICP) at Attari, Punjab. By May 1st, 2025, only those who have crossed across with legitimate documentation will be allowed to return.

3. **Cancellation of SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme for Pakistan**  
   For Pakistani nationals, India has terminated the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES). Any SVES visas that have already been granted are deemed null and invalid.

4. **Expulsion of Pakistani Military Advisors**  
   The advisors for Pakistan’s air, navy, and defense in New Delhi have been deemed *persona non grata* and are required to leave India. Moreover, India will remove its own experts from Islamabad.

5. **Reduction of Diplomatic Personnel**  
   By May 1, 2025, India plans to cut the number of employees at its High Commission in Islamabad from 55 to 30. With the intention of halting formal bilateral communication, this is a blatant decline in diplomatic interaction.
